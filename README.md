A simple apple shooter written in Python for the G51FSE module at the University of Nottingham, spring semester 2012/13.

Game Concept
------------

The aim of the game is to control an archer’s angle and power as desired and then fire an arrow at apples on a tree, trying avoiding moving obstacles that reduce the time remaining in the game. It is a twist on the classic apple shooter where users tend to fire apples situated on someone’s head, avoiding the person below the apple, and has greater complexity to it than most similar classic games.
